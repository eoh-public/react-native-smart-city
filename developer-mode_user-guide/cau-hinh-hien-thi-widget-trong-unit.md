# Setup Web Dashboard

Now we need to setup a dashboard template to interact with our device and visualize data from it.

1/ Navigate to the Template you created before.

2/ Go to Dashboard Tab and drag-n-drop these widgets to the canvas: Swith, label , chart, button…etc

3/ Drag and drop them to

&#x20;

After widgets are added you can apply the following **actions**:

* **Re-Arrange** – drag the widgets to a position you want so you can form desired dashboard view
* **Delete** – permanently deletes the widget. Hover the widget and navigate to top right, click bin pictogram.
* **Clone** – clones the selected widget (also it can be applied to the configured widget). Hover the widget and navigate to top right, click clone pictogram.
* **Configure** – opens widget configuration window.

**IMPORTANT!** At this stage you have set up a dashboard _template_ only and it will not yet connect to your actual devices. You will need to save the template and apply it to actual devices.

In order to see actual data and interact with your device, you need to go to your devices: Search -> My Devices -> Device

The User can be config for a single widget added.
